- I am an AI research scientist passionate about the intellectual challenges of truly understanding AI systems and advancing AI research. 
- I am also passionate about the ethical and societal aspects related to the AI revolution. I sincerely wish to devote my skills to meaningful projects that will bring sustainable, harmonious and fair solutions to the great challenges ahead of us.

# Background

- Since Sep 2018, I work as freelance and AI research scientist under the trademark "Labatie-AI". During my research, I developed a unifying framework to characterize the broad spectrum of potential pathologies in deep neural networks at initialization. This led to a [single-author paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03087) accepted for publication at ICML 2019.

- From Feb 2017 to Aug 2018, I worked as the lead AI research engineer in the AgTech startup PEAT [[Slides of my presentation at Berlin AI](/files/2018-05-23-BerlinAI.pdf)]. I also worked as AI research engineer in 2 CleanTech startups in Paris from 2012 to 2017.

- Concerning my education, I went through the very selective French system of Grandes Ecoles. I did my last year as an exchange student at the University of Cambridge. There I graduated 1st among all applied mathematics students (~ 100 elite students) in the Part III of the Mathematical Tripos 2008 [[Wikipedia page with list of Mayhew Prize winners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayhew_Prize)]. The next year, I graduated from the Master "Mathematics, Vision, Learning" at ENS Cachan, and finally I graduated from a PhD in Astrostatistics under the supervision of [Jean-Luc Starck](http://jstarck.cosmostat.org/).
