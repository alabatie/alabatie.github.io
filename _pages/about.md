- I am an A.I. scientist passionate about the intellectual challenges of truly understanding A.I. systems and advancing A.I. research. 
- I am also passionate about the ethical and societal aspects related to the A.I. revolution. I sincerely wish to devote my skills to meaningful projects that will bring sustainable, harmonious and fair solutions to the great challenges ahead of us.

# Background

- Since the beginning of 2017, I work as the main A.I. scientist at the AgTech startup PEAT in Berlin. PEAT created the Smartphone App [Plantix](https://plantix.net/), which provides Image Recognition (currently recognizes ~290 crop diseases with high accuracy) and guidance for small-scale farmers. If you want more information on Artificial Intelligence at PEAT, I presented many aspects at the gathering Berlin A.I. [[Slides](/files/2018-05-23-BerlinAI.pdf)]. From 2012 to 2017, I was also A.I. scientist in 2 CleanTech startups Eqinov and Smart Impulse in Paris.

- In these positions, I faced very difficult problems in the fields of image recognition, time-series analysis and optimal control, that I solved using the latest A.I. advances, in particular deep learning (CNNs, RNNs, FFNs, DQNs).

- Concerning my education, I went through the very selective French system of Grandes Ecoles. I did my last year as an exchange student in the prestigious master course "Part III of the Mathematical Tripos" at the University of Cambridge, where I was awarded the [Mayhew Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayhew_Prize) for graduating in 1st place among ~ 100 elite students. The next year, I graduated from the Master "Mathematics, Vision, Learning" at ENS Cachan, and finally I graduated from a Ph.D. in Astrostatistics at the laboratory CosmoStat, CEA Saclay under the supervision of [Jean-Luc Starck](http://jstarck.cosmostat.org/).
