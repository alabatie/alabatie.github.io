- I am an A.I. scientist passionate about the intellectual challenges of truly understanding A.I. systems and advancing A.I. research. 
- I am also passionate about the ethical and societal aspects related to the A.I. revolution. I sincerely wish to devote my skills to meaningful projects that will bring sustainable, harmonious and fair solutions to the great challenges ahead of us.

# Background

- Since September 2018, I work on my own research projetcs and I provide teaching and mentoring in A.I. Previously, I worked as the main A.I. scientist at the AgTech startup PEAT [[Slides of my presentation at Berlin A.I.](/files/2018-05-23-BerlinAI.pdf)]. I also worked as A.I. scientist in 2 CleanTech startups in Paris from 2012 to 2017.

- Concerning my education, I went through the very selective French system of Grandes Ecoles. I did my last year as an exchange student in the "Part III of the Mathematical Tripos" at the University of Cambridge, where I was awarded the Mayhew Prize in 2008 [[Link]]. The next year, I graduated from the Master "Mathematics, Vision, Learning" at ENS Cachan, and finally I graduated from a Ph.D. in Astrostatistics at the laboratory CosmoStat, CEA Saclay under the supervision of [Jean-Luc Starck](http://jstarck.cosmostat.org/).
